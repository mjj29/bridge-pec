\section{Prepared Defences}
\label{appx:defences}

Please note that the EBU does not recommend providing prepared defences to
systems.  Nontheless, if you would find these useful here are some {\em simple}
defences to our system, but there are probably several better ones.

\subsection{1 level bids}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1$\clubsuit$
	One of the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Your defence to a possibly short club
	\item Your defence to a weak no-trump
	\item Your defence to a natural club opening 
	\item Your defence to a polish club
	\end{itemize}
\item 1$\diamondsuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Defend the same as you would a strong (e.g. precision) club
	\end{itemize}
\item 1$\heartsuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = a heart overcall
	\item 1$\spadesuit$ = takeout of spades
	\item 1N = normal 1N overcall range showing a spade stop
	\item suits = natural overcalls
	\item 2$\spadesuit$ = whatever a cue of a natural 1 spade would mean 
	\item Jump bids = normal jump-overcall range
	\end{itemize}
\item 1$\spadesuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = takeout of hearts
	\item 1N = normal 1N overcall range showing a heart stop
	\item suits = natural overcalls
	\item 2$\heartsuit$ = whatever a cue of a natural 1 heart would mean 
	\item Jump bids = normal jump-overcall range
	\end{itemize}

\item 1NT
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = clubs and diamonds
	\item 2$\clubsuit$/$\diamondsuit$ = natural overcall
	\item 2$\heartsuit$/$\spadesuit$ = asking for a stop for NT
	\item 2NT = decent NT overcall range with stops in both majors
	\item Jump bids = normal jump-overcall range
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2 level bids}

\begin{itemize}
\item 2$\clubsuit$/$\diamondsuit$/$\heartsuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = an overcall in the suit bid
	\item suits = natural overcalls
	\item 2N = normal 2N over a weak-two range with some values in the other three suits
	\end{itemize}
\item 2$\spadesuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = takeout of hearts
	\item 2N = normal 2N over a weak-two range with a decent heart stop
	\item suits = natural overcalls
	\end{itemize}
\item 2NT
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = takeout (showing hearts and clubs)
	\item 3$\clubsuit$/$\heartsuit$ = natural overcalls
	\item 3$\diamondsuit$/$\spadesuit$ = asking for a stop for 3NT
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{3/4 level bids}

\begin{itemize}
\item 3$\clubsuit$/$\diamondsuit$/$\heartsuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = an overcall in the suit bid
	\item next suit = takeout of that suit
	\item 3N = normal 3N over a 3-level preempt with a stop in the suit shown (not bid)
	\end{itemize}
\item 3$\spadesuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = spade overcall (as of a 4-minor preempt or gambling 3N opening)
	\item suits = natural overcalls (as of a 4-minor preempt or gambling 3N opening)
	\end{itemize}
\item 3NT
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = both majors (takeoutish)
	\item suits = natural overcalls (as of a 4-minor preempt)
	\end{itemize}
\item 4$\clubsuit$/$\diamondsuit$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item X = an overcall in the suit bid (as of a 3-major preempt)
	\item suits = natural overcalls (as of a 3-major preempt)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
