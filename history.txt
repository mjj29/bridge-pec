System notes on Pascal's Encrypted Club

A brief history:

We wanted to play a system making use of encrypted bidding.  Our first attempt used a fairly standard Acol structure, with a weak NT and three weak 2s.  It was soon apparent that crypto raises in these circumstances (requiring 11+, 4-card support and either A or K but not both) never come up, at least to a first approximation.

We also quite liked the idea of light and limited openings.  This was from a couple of experiments with a (highly illegal) forcing pass system, where a pass in first or second seat showed any 12+, with 0-11 HCP hands forced to open somehow.  In particular, 2-suited bids at the 1-level have a lot of attractions.

Our next attempt was to consider the idea of a 12+ 1C opener, with all other openings 8-11.  This is fine in theory, but EBU regulations say that this 1C opener cannot have a 5+ card major suit without a longer minor.  This meant that we needed an opening-values 2C bid, and generally lost the point of the system.  We fell back upon a strong club structure.

Given the strong C structure, we then looked at our other opening bids.  Our 2-level openers are pre-emptive, and show either single-suiters or two-suiters.  This is based upon the Suction convention: 2C shows D or both majors, 2D shows H or S&C, 2H shows S or C&D, and 2S shows H and a minor.  We don't have a way to show a S&D two-suiter; this is a likely future use for 2NT.

Major suit openings are played as takeout bids.  This means that 1S promises 5+ H and 0-3 S, with 1H promising 5+ S and 0-3 H.  These were, at one stage, 4-card openings in the other major, but we found that this made bidding in competition too difficult.  In uncontested auctions, this has the great advantage that you gain a "free" cue-bid: after a 1S opening, 2S shows a good raise of H while 2H, 3H etc. are pre-emptive.

The next implication is that we need a way to show hands with 4+ in both majors.  This falls to 1NT; we have 2C/2D/2H/2S as weak bids "to play", and 2NT as a strong enquiry.  Bids in the major suits are primarily pre-emptive; 2NT asks for range and better major.  3m is strong and one-round forcing.

1C includes balanced hands 16-19 and 23+ (we're using 2NT as a 20-22 balanced hand, for now).  The 1D opening, therefore, has to cover all opening hands that do not fall into one of the above categories.  It therefore includes:
    - 12-15 balanced.
    - Unbalanced hands, 8-15, with no 5-card major and at most one 4-card major.

Responses to 1D are selected to allow the 1NT rebid, showing a weak NT opener, on all auctions.  Therefore: 1H = 0-7, 1S = 8+.  After interference, pass is weak; any other action promises 8+.

So that's our one-level openings.  For two-level openers, we wanted them to be the two-suited bids we'd originally considered for our one-level openings.  I can't remember if it was Matt or me who first found out about Suction as a defence to 1NT, or who suggested it as a structure for 2-level openings, but the fact remains that we like it.  Essentially, each 2-level bid shows either a weak 2 in the suit above OR the other two suits.  Of course, this leaves the non-touching pairs uncovered, and leaves you with two ways to show a pre-empt in clubs.  We soon thought of playing 2S as showing H and a minor (as opposed to the original C or H&D).  This still left S&D uncovered, but we decided to cope.

At this stage, our 2NT opening was fairly standard: 20-22 balanced or semi-balanced.  After a few sessions playing, we modified this to include the spade-diamond two-suiters.  Of course, that makes the bid forcing, so we changed the NT ranges such that this included our game-forcing NT hands: any 23+.  Responses are suit preference, on the assumption that the weak hand is more frequent, with transfer preference being used if responder has a strong hand.  If opener has the strong option, he can rebid 3NT.

The next change (there's still more!) was to include GF two-suiters in our 2-level openings.  This narrows the specification of the 1C opening, and is easy to specify: opener can rebid his opened suit (whichever it is) over any response.  In the 2NT case, this opening now shows GF (semi-)balanced, GF with S&D, or weak with S&D.  In the two-suited case, any rebid other than 3NT shows the strong hand, and any transfer break does also.

Finally, our responses to 1C: initially, these were natural, promising a 4-card suit and 8+ (with any weak hands going via 1D).  Boring!  We then tried encrypted responses: 1H promised HA or HK, not both; 1S showed neither or both in H, and exactly one in S, and so on.  1NT was a positive with no potential key; 1D was the negative.  Opener would rebid NT if balanced, 2H to deny a potential key, and anything else to show a potential place to play if holding the key K or denying if holding the key A.  We ditched this structure not because it doesn't work but because it frequently (read nearly always) ends up at the 3-level before either hand has actually mentioned a suit, which could still be only 4 cards.

We now play a far more elegant structure, similar to our responses to 1D: 1D is negative (0-7), 1H is positive distributional (8+), and 1S is positive balanced (8+, again).

As for the system name: suction is measured in Pascals, and the system is encrypted.  It went from there.


System description:

NB: R18 means "rule of 18"; the HCP added to the number of cards in the two longest suits must be greater than or equal to 18.

Opening bids:

1C: 16-22 balanced or semi-balanced; 16+ single-suited (at least 6 cards, and concentrated honours); or 16-20 (ish) two-suited.

1D: 12-15 balanced; or 8/R18-15 with no 5-card major and no two 4-card majors.  Think of this as "any opening hand that doesn't fit 1C, 1H, 1S or 1NT".

1H: 8/R18-15, with 0-3 H and 5+ S.
1S: 8/R18-15, with 0-3 S and 5+ H.
  Note that these promise the OTHER major!

1NT: 8/R18-15, 4+ H, 4+ S.

2C: either a weak 2 in D, or H&S two-suiter (weak or game-forcing).
2D: either a weak 2 in H, or S&C two-suiter (weak or game-forcing).
2H: either a weak 2 in S, or C&D two-suiter (weak or game-forcing).

2S: H and a minor, weak or game-forcing.

2NT: 23+ (semi-)balanced, or S&D two-suiter (weak or game-forcing).

3-level and above: your choice; we play natural pre-empts.


Responses and rebids:

After 1C:
1D = 0-7, any shape.
1H = 8+, non-balanced.
1S = 8+, balanced.

    Opener's rebids:
        1NT = 16-19 balanced (after 1D response)
              16-17 balanced (after 1H/1S response)
        2NT = 20-22 balanced (after 1D response)
              18-22 balanced (after 1H response)
              18-19 balanced (after 1S response)
        3NT = 20-22 balanced (after 1S response)

    simple suit rebid: one-suited in the suit above, or two-suited:
        C = D or H&S
        D = H or S&m
        H = S or H&m
        S = C or C&D

    A jump suit rebid is a game-forcing single-suited hand.  Further bids are first-round controls; responder should bid game with no slam interest.

    After a simple suit rebid following 1C-1D, responder accepts the transfer with weakness, or acts otherwise with 5-7.  Opener can pass this rebid.
    After opener's S rebid, a NT bid by responder asks for clarification: opener should bid C with the single-suited hand; D with both.  Note that this NT enquiry should include D preference if responder is weak.
    
    After 1C-1H/S-rebid...


After 1D:
1H = 0-7, any shape.
1S = 8+, any shape.

    Opener's rebids:
        1NT = 12-15 balanced.
        Major suit shows exactly 4 cards, and either 4=1=4=4/1=4=4=4 or a 5+-card minor.
        Minor suit denies a 4-card major and denies a balanced hand, so shows 5+.

After 1H:
P = VERY rare!  Long H suit, no spades, no chance of game.
1S    = 0-5, 2+ S.
1NT   = 0-9, 0-1 S.
2C/2D = 6-9 with 3+ S and a side suit, or 10+ with 0-2 S.
2H    = Good raise of S (3+ cards, 10+ HCP); neither or both of S AK.
2S    = Pre-emptive raise of S (3 cards, 6-9).
2NT   = Encrypted raise; 3+ S, 10+ HCP; exactly one of S AK.
3C/3D = Fit jump; good raise with neither or both of S AK and a useful side suit.
3H    = Encrypted raise 2; 4+ S, 10+ HCP; exactly two of S AKQ.
3S    = Pre-emptive raise of S (4 cards, 5-9).
3NT   = To play.
4C    = Splinter.
4D    = Splinter.
4H    = To play.  Probably a 4H opener with a spade void, or a hand where you'd open 1H and rebid 4H in a natural system.
4S    = To play.

After 1S:
P = VERY rare!  Long S suit, no hearts, no chance of game.
1NT   = 0-9, 0-2 H.
2C/2D = 6-9 with 3+ H and a side suit, or 10+ with 0-2 H.
2H    = Pre-emptive raise of H (3 cards, 6-9).
2S    = Good raise of H (3+ cards, 10+ HCP); neither or both of H AK.
2NT   = Encrypted raise; 3+ H, 10+ HCP; exactly one of H AK.
3C/3D = Fit jump; good raise with neither or both of H AK and a useful side suit.
3H    = Pre-emptive raise of H (4 cards, 5-9).
3S    = Encrypted raise 2; 4+ H, 10+ HCP; exactly two of H AKQ.
3NT   = To play.
4C    = Splinter.
4D    = Splinter.
4H    = To play.
4S    = To play.  Probably a 4S opener with a heart void, or a hand where you'd open 1S and rebid 4S in a natural system.

After 1NT:
2C/2D = To play.  Long suit, weak hand.
2H/2S = To play.  Simple preference, weak hand.
2NT   = Range/suit enquiry.
3C/3D = Good hand, long minor.
3H/3S = Encrypted raise (one of AK, 4+ card support, game-forcing strength).
3NT   = To play.
4C/4D = Undiscussed.  Probably either a splinter or transfer preference, but would you want to guess at the table?
4H/4S = To play.

    Rebids after the 2NT enquiry:
    3C/3H show better H than S.
    3D/3S show better S than H.
    minor suits show weaker hands (8-11); major suits show better hands (12-15, probably with extra shape).

After 2C:
2D = Almost automatic.
Any other bid indicates willingness to play at least 3D opposite a weak 2 in D, and is one-round forcing.

After 2D:
2H = Almost automatic.
Any other bid indicates willingness to play at least 3H opposite a weak 2 in H, and is one-round forcing.

After 2H:
2S = Almost automatic.
Any other bid indicates willingness to play at least 3H opposite a weak 2 in S, and is one-round forcing.

Opener's rebid of 3 of the opened suit shows the game-forcing two-suited option.  We've not had to consider developments after this (how often does it come up?), but suggest that responder gives cheap preference if slam is possible and just picks a game if weak.

After 2S:
2NT = Tell me which minor.
3C  = Prefer C to D; correct to H with H&D weak.
3D  = Prefer D to C; correct to H with H&C weak.
3H  = To play opposite the weak option.
3NT = To play opposite the weak option.
4H  = To play opposite the weak option.

Similarly, opener can rebid 3S (if sufficient) when holding the strong hand; after 2S-3NT, 4C/D shows that minor and is game-forcing.  After 2S-4H, 4S/4NT are RKCB for H, with S showing side C and NT showing side D.

After 2NT:
3C/3D show D preference.
3H/3S show S preference.
3C/3H are stronger, as they automatically grant a rebid.

If opener rebids 3NT, he has a game-forcing (semi-)balanced hand.  Continuations are whatever you'd play here anyway.
Opener's transfer break or rebid after simple preference shows a first-round control and the game-forcing hand.


Encrypted bidding:

This is the fun part!

Once responder makes an encrypted raise, opener can either accept or decline the key.  To decline, simply rebid the suit (cheaply with a minimum; jump if maximum.  Use common sense.).

If the key is accepted, subsequent bids are either two-way or three-way, depending on the key.

Two-way encryption:
This is far more common, as it requires responder and opener to have one each of the trump AK.
Opener's rebid shows a useful side-suit if holding the trump K (0-1 losers) or a potential weakness if holding the trump A (2-3 losers).  Responder can then either place the contract, cue-bid (either showing with the K or denying with the A), or use Blackwood.
Blackwood here is Roman Keycard, but it's both encrypted and modified: 5C is 0/3 with the trump A, 1 with the trump K. 5D is 1 with the trump A, 0/3 with the trump K. 5H is 2 without the Q, and 5S is 2 with.  Note that there are only 3 keycards still of interest!

Three-way encryption:
Requires AKQ of trumps between the two hands, and enough values for a game-forcing raise in responder's hand.  Rare!
Opener's rebid shows a first-round control; the location of this control is encrypted.  We use the concept of the shift here: a shift of 1 indicates the next suit up (C from NT or S, D from C, H from D, S from H).  A shift of 2 indicates the next suit after that, and a shift of 3 shows the final suit.  Each cue therefore says nothing about control in the suit bid.
The sum of the shift and the HCP of opener's honour is 5.  Opener, holding a D control, therefore bids C with the trump A, S/NT with the trump K, and H with the trump Q.
Of course, Blackwood goes funny here too.  You only need to show 0-3 keycards, and the location of the Q is known, so 0/3 - 1 - 2 would seem a sensible set of responses.

Does your brain hurt yet?  I haven't even started on competitive bidding...


Competitive bidding:

Overcalls are constructive and for takeout, promising the two unbid suits.  Where opponents have shown two suits, overcalls are natural.
When responding to an overcall, a bid of one of the suits is simply competitive and showing preference.  A good raise of the cheaper suit can be shown with the cheaper cuebid, and a good raise of the other suit can be shown with the other cuebid.  Similarly, 1NT and 2NT can be used as encrypted raises of the cheaper and higher suits respectively.

This means that a double needs to include the possibility of a single-suited hand, on which one might make a natural overcall.  Responder should make the cheapest bid if holding a very weak hand.

All strong hands are shown via an immediate cuebid of opponent's suit.  Again, a next-step response is negative.

Two-suited pre-emptive hands can be shown via 2NT.  It is worth noting that this is the Tom Jones 2NT: It's Not Unusual.  This promises both majors over a minor-suit opening, or the other major and an unspecified minor over a minor-suit opening.  Jump overcalls are weak; jump overcalls of a major suit over a minor-suit opening may include the other minor (possible canape).  Similarly, jump overcalls of 3C over a 1 of a major opening could include D.

Jump cuebids are stopper-asking for 3NT; they promise a long running suit.  An overcall of 3NT promises a long running suit and a stopper.
